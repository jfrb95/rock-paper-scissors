This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game played in the console against a basic AI.

The user input is not case sensitive, and the prompt will repeat until a valid input is given.

This project was later revisited and a UI was created. This exercise was used to practice git branching, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

The UI is very basic as making it look nice was not part of the exercise.
